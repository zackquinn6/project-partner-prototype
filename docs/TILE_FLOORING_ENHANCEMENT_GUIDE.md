## CUT OPERATION - Step 1: Wet Saw Cut

### Description (1-2 lines)
```
Master wet saw cutting for clean, professional tile edges.
```

### Content Sections

#### Section 1: Overview (Text)
**Title:** Overview  
**Content:**
```
The wet saw is your primary tool for straight cuts in ceramic, porcelain, and natural stone tile. Water cooling prevents blade overheating and reduces dust.
```

#### Section 2: Safety Warning
**Title:** Safety Critical  
**Severity:** High  
**Content:**
```
Always wear safety glasses and ear protection. Never reach over or behind the blade. Keep hands at least 6 inches from the blade at all times. Ensure the water reservoir is full before starting - a dry blade can shatter.
```

#### Section 3: Detailed Instructions (Text)
**Title:** Detailed Instructions  
**Content:**
```
Begin by measuring and marking your cut line on the tile face using a pencil or marker. Set up the wet saw on a stable surface with the water pump running - you should see a steady stream flowing over the blade.

Align the tile against the fence, positioning your cut line with the blade path. For your first few cuts, practice on scrap tiles to get comfortable with the saw's speed and handling.

Turn on the saw and let it reach full speed before engaging the tile. Feed the tile slowly and steadily into the blade - let the blade do the work, don't force it. A good cutting speed is about 1 inch per second for ceramic, slower for porcelain or stone.

Keep firm, even pressure on the tile and maintain contact with the fence throughout the cut. For long cuts, support the tile on both sides of the blade to prevent breakage.

As you complete the cut, slow down slightly for the last inch to prevent chipping on the exit side. Allow the blade to come to a complete stop before removing cut pieces.

After cutting, inspect edges for chips. Minor roughness is normal and will be hidden by grout, but significant chips require a new cut with slower feed rate.

### Tools
1. **Wet Tile Saw** (Qty: 1) - 7-10 inch diamond blade recommended
2. **Safety Glasses** (Qty: 1) - ANSI Z87.1 rated
3. **Ear Protection** (Qty: 1) - NRR 25+ rating
4. **Measuring Tape** (Qty: 1) - For accurate measurements

### Process Variables (Inputs)
1. **Blade Sharpness** (Type: Selection) - Options: Sharp, Moderate, Dull - Description: "Fresh blades cut cleaner with less chipping"
2. **Cutting Speed** (Type: Number) - Unit: inches/second - Description: "Slower speeds (0.5-1 in/sec) reduce chipping, faster speeds overheat blade"
3. **Water Flow Rate** (Type: Measurement) - Unit: GPM - Description: "Adequate water prevents blade overheating and dust"
4. **Tile Support Position** (Type: Selection) - Options: Both sides supported, One side supported, Unsupported - Description: "Proper support prevents tile breakage mid-cut"

### Outputs
1. **Clean Cut Edges** (Type: major-aesthetics)
   - **Requirement:** Cut edges must be smooth with chips less than 1/16 inch, hidden by grout joint
   - **Potential Effects:** Chipped or rough edges create visible gaps after grouting, look unprofessional, and may require tile replacement. Large chips (>1/8 inch) cannot be hidden by grout and will always be visible. This wastes material and time.
   - **Key Inputs:** Blade sharpness, Cutting speed, Water flow rate, Tile support
   - **Quality Checks:** Inspect each cut edge immediately. Run your finger along the cut - it should feel smooth. Any chips should be smaller than the grout joint width. If you see large chips, adjust cutting speed or replace the blade.

2. **Accurate Dimensions** (Type: major-aesthetics)
   - **Requirement:** Cuts must be within 1/32 inch of target measurement
   - **Potential Effects:** Inaccurate cuts cause cascading layout problems. Tiles that are too small create large, uneven grout joints. Tiles too large won't fit and must be recut. This compounds across rows, potentially requiring complete layout revision.
   - **Key Inputs:** Measurement accuracy, Fence alignment, Blade condition
   - **Quality Checks:** Measure each cut tile before installation. Check the first tile in each row extra carefully - it sets the pattern for everything after.

### Time Estimation
- **Low (Experienced):** 2 minutes per cut
- **Medium (Average DIYer):** 3 minutes per cut  
- **High (Beginner):** 5 minutes per cut

## MIX OPERATION - Step 1: Mix Thinset

### Description (1-2 lines)
```
Achieve the critical peanut butter consistency for proper tile adhesion.
```

### Content Sections

#### Section 1: Overview (Text)
**Title:** Overview  
**Content:**
```
Thinset mortar bonds your tiles to the substrate. Getting the consistency right is crucial - too wet and it won't hold, too dry and it won't spread properly.
```

#### Section 2: Safety Warning
**Title:** Health Precaution  
**Severity:** Medium  
**Content:**
```
Wear a dust mask when handling dry thinset powder - it contains cement and silica that can irritate lungs. Wear rubber gloves - wet mortar is alkaline and can burn skin with prolonged contact. Work in ventilated area.
```

#### Section 3: Detailed Instructions (Text)
**Title:** Detailed Instructions  
**Content:**
```
Start by reading the thinset bag instructions for the correct water-to-powder ratio. Most thinsets use approximately 5-7 quarts of water per 50-pound bag, but this varies by brand and type.

Pour WATER into your mixing bucket first, then add powder gradually. This prevents lumps and makes mixing easier. Add about 75% of the total powder initially, reserving some for consistency adjustment.

Use a drill with a paddle mixer attachment set to low speed (300-400 RPM). Insert the mixer into the mortar and turn it on. Mix for 2-3 minutes, moving the paddle up and down and around the bucket to eliminate all dry pockets and lumps.

Check consistency by pulling the paddle out and letting mortar fall back into the bucket. Perfect thinset should be like smooth peanut butter - it should hold peaks but not be stiff. If you can see the paddle mesh through the mortar, it's too thin. If it's difficult to mix or won't hold peaks, it's too dry.

Once mixed, let the mortar slake (rest) for 5-10 minutes. This allows the cement to fully hydrate. After slaking, remix for 1 minute without adding water. The consistency may change slightly during slaking - this is normal.

Mixed thinset has a working time (pot life) of 2-4 hours in typical conditions. However, it begins to stiffen after about 30-45 minutes. Mix only what you can use in 30 minutes to start. As you gain experience, you can mix larger batches.

### Materials
1. **Thinset Mortar** - Per manufacturer specs - Modified or unmodified as specified
2. **Water** - Per bag instructions - Clean, room temperature

### Tools
1. **5-Gallon Mixing Bucket** (Qty: 1) - Clean, no debris
2. **Paddle Mixer** (Qty: 1) - For drill, 300-600 RPM
3. **Drill** (Qty: 1) - Variable speed, corded preferred
4. **Dust Mask** (Qty: 1) - N95 rated
5. **Rubber Gloves** (Qty: 1) - Chemical resistant

### Process Variables (Inputs)
1. **Water-to-Powder Ratio** (Type: Measurement) - Unit: by weight - Description: "Critical ratio per manufacturer specs, typically 5-7 quarts per 50lb bag"
2. **Mixing Time** (Type: Number) - Unit: minutes - Description: "2-3 minutes initial mix, then slake 5-10 min, then 1 min remix"
3. **Mix Consistency** (Type: Selection) - Options: Soupy, Correct (peanut butter), Stiff - Description: "Should hold peaks but spread smoothly"
4. **Slake Time** (Type: Number) - Unit: minutes - Description: "5-10 minute rest allows cement hydration"

### Upstream Variables (Reference from prior steps)
1. **Ambient Temperature** (Type: Upstream) - Source: Environmental Conditions - Target: 50-90°F - Description: "Temperature affects working time and cure rate"
2. **Substrate Type** (Type: Upstream) - Source: Subfloor Prep - Target: Clean, level surface - Description: "Different substrates may require different thinset types"

### Outputs
1. **Correct Thinset Consistency** (Type: performance-durability)
   - **Requirement:** Mortar must hold firm peaks like peanut butter, spreading smoothly without being soupy or stiff
   - **Potential Effects:** Incorrect consistency is the #1 cause of tile failure. Too wet: tiles slide, mortar doesn't bond properly, excessive shrinkage creates voids where water penetrates leading to loose tiles and substrate damage. Too dry: won't spread properly, creates air pockets, prevents full tile contact, leads to hollow spots that crack under foot traffic. These problems cannot be fixed after installation without removing all tiles.
   - **Key Inputs:** Water-to-powder ratio, Mixing time, Mixing speed, Slake time
   - **Quality Checks:** Perform the peak test: scoop mortar with trowel and flip it over. Mortar should cling and hold shape. Make a ridge in the bucket - it should hold but slowly relax. If it runs or slumps immediately, too wet. If it crumbles or won't hold shape, too dry.

### Time Estimation  
- **Low (Experienced):** 5 minutes per batch
- **Medium (Average DIYer):** 8 minutes per batch
- **High (Beginner):** 12 minutes per batch

## SET OPERATION - Step 2: Apply Thinset

### Description (1-2 lines)
```
Apply mortar with proper trowel technique for maximum tile adhesion.
```

### Content Sections

#### Section 1: Overview (Text)
**Title:** Overview  
**Content:**
```
Proper trowel technique ensures 95%+ mortar coverage, which is critical for tile longevity. The trowel size, angle, and direction all affect your results.
```

#### Section 2: Detailed Instructions (Text)
**Title:** Detailed Instructions  
**Content:**
```
Select the correct trowel notch size for your tile. For most floor tiles 12x12 and smaller, use a 1/4 x 3/8 inch U-notch or square notch. Larger tiles (up to 15x15) need 1/2 x 1/2 inch. Extra large format tiles require specialized trowels - consult manufacturer specifications.

Scoop mortar onto the floor with the flat side of your trowel. Spread it in a smooth layer about 1/4 inch thick using the flat edge, covering an area you can tile in 10-15 minutes (about 3-4 square feet to start).

Flip to the notched side and hold the trowel at a 45-degree angle to the substrate. This angle is critical - too shallow (less than 30 degrees) and the ridges are too short, too steep (more than 60 degrees) and you scrape off too much mortar.

Pull the trowel through the mortar in straight lines, maintaining constant pressure and angle. The notches should create uniform, parallel ridges. Don't swirl or use circular motions - straight lines only. Orient your trowel lines in the same direction across your entire work area.

The ridges should stand up proudly and hold their shape. If they slump or flatten immediately, your mortar is too wet. If they crumble or look ragged, it's too dry - discard and remix.

Work in small sections. Mortar begins to skin over in 20-30 minutes depending on conditions. If a skin forms (mortar looks dull rather than wet/shiny), scrape it off and reapply fresh mortar. Installing tiles over skinned mortar results in poor bonding.

For walls, work from bottom up in sections no larger than 2x3 feet. Gravity makes mortar slump faster on vertical surfaces.

### Tools
1. **Notched Trowel** (Qty: 1) - Size based on tile dimensions
2. **Flat Trowel** (Qty: 1) - For spreading and cleaning
3. **Kneeling Pad** (Qty: 1) - Reduces knee strain

### Process Variables (Inputs)
1. **Trowel Notch Size** (Type: Selection) - Options: 1/4x3/8", 1/2x1/2", Custom - Description: "Larger tiles require larger notches for adequate coverage"
2. **Trowel Angle** (Type: Number) - Unit: degrees - Description: "45° is optimal, range 30-60° acceptable"
3. **Thinset Coverage Percentage** (Type: Number) - Unit: % - Description: "Must achieve 95%+ coverage on tile back"
4. **Application Pressure** (Type: Selection) - Options: Light, Medium, Firm - Description: "Firm, consistent pressure creates uniform ridges"

### Upstream Variables
1. **Thinset Consistency** (Type: Upstream) - Source: Mix Thinset - Target: Peanut butter consistency - Description: "Proper consistency critical for ridge formation"
2. **Floor Flatness** (Type: Upstream) - Source: Subfloor Prep - Target: ±1/8" in 10ft - Description: "Flat substrates allow consistent mortar thickness"

### Outputs
1. **Uniform Trowel Ridges** (Type: performance-durability)
   - **Requirement:** All ridges must be consistent height and spacing, standing upright, oriented in same direction
   - **Potential Effects:** Inconsistent ridges create uneven mortar coverage. Low spots have inadequate bond strength and tiles will eventually pop loose. High spots cause lippage (uneven tile surface) that cannot be corrected. Poor coverage allows water infiltration leading to substrate damage, mold growth, and expensive repairs requiring full tile removal.
   - **Key Inputs:** Trowel notch size, Trowel angle, Mortar consistency, Application pressure
   - **Quality Checks:** After troweling each section, look at your ridges from a low angle. They should all be the same height and clearly visible. Run your hand over them - they should feel like a washboard with sharp, distinct ridges.

2. **95% Mortar Coverage Target** (Type: performance-durability)
   - **Requirement:** Tile back must show 95%+ mortar contact when lifted immediately after setting
   - **Potential Effects:** Coverage below 95% creates voids where tiles have no support. These hollow areas telegraph through as squeaky or spongy spots underfoot. Under load (foot traffic, furniture), unsupported tiles crack. In wet areas, voids collect water causing grout failure, efflorescence, and tile debonding. This is the most common cause of premature tile failure.
   - **Key Inputs:** Trowel angle, Trowel notch size, Mortar consistency, Substrate flatness
   - **Quality Checks:** Lift and check the first tile in each section - you must do this. The back should be 95%+ covered with mortar. If you see bare spots or the trowel-line pattern is still visible, you have insufficient coverage. Adjust trowel angle, use larger notches, or back-butter tiles.

### Time Estimation (per 10 sq ft)
- **Low (Experienced):** 3 minutes
- **Medium (Average DIYer):** 5 minutes
- **High (Beginner):** 8 minutes

## SET OPERATION - Step 3: Set Tile

### Description (1-2 lines)
```
Press tiles into mortar bed with proper technique to avoid lippage and ensure coverage.
```

### Content Sections

#### Section 1: Overview (Text)
**Title:** Overview  
**Content:**
```
How you set each tile determines the final floor quality. Proper technique ensures tiles are level, properly spaced, and fully adhered.
```

#### Section 2: Detailed Instructions (Text)
**Title:** Detailed Instructions  
**Content:**
```
Before setting any tile, have your spacers ready. For floor tile, 1/8 inch to 3/16 inch spacers are most common. Larger tiles often use 1/4 inch spacing to account for size variation.

Pick up your first tile and position it over the mortar bed. Lower it straight down - don't slide it into place as this displaces mortar. Once positioned, use a slight back-and-forth twisting motion (like wringing a towel) while applying firm downward pressure. You should feel the tile seat into the mortar.

Using your hands or a rubber mallet with a beating block, press down firmly on the tile surface. Work from the center outward to push out air pockets. Use moderate force - enough to collapse the mortar ridges but not so much that mortar squeezes up more than halfway into the grout joint.

Immediately place spacers on all four sides (or four corners depending on spacer type). Push them firmly against the tile edge so they maintain consistent spacing. Some installers use a tile leveling system instead of simple spacers - these help prevent lippage on large format tiles.

Set your second tile adjacent to the first, again lowering straight down. Before pressing it into place, align it carefully with the first tile and spacers. Press and wiggle as before, keeping it level with the first tile. Check alignment with a straightedge.

As you set tiles, use a level frequently to check both individual tiles and across multiple tiles. For every 3-4 tiles set, lay a 4-foot level across them. No tile edge should be more than 1/16 inch higher or lower than adjacent tiles (lippage). If you find lippage, you have a few minutes to pull the high tile up, adjust mortar thickness, and reset.

Work in small sections, setting 6-10 tiles at a time before moving on. This keeps you working over fresh mortar. Every 15-20 minutes, lift a random tile to check mortar coverage on the back. You should see 95%+ coverage with no visible voids.

If you need to make adjustments, you typically have 20-30 minutes before mortar begins to set. After that window, leave tiles alone - moving them breaks the bond.

### Tools
1. **Tile Spacers** (Qty: 4 per tile) - 1/8" to 1/4" depending on tile
2. **Rubber Mallet** (Qty: 1) - For seating tiles
3. **Beating Block** (Qty: 1) - Protects tile surface
4. **4-Foot Level** (Qty: 1) - Check multiple tiles at once
5. **Straightedge** (Qty: 1) - Verify alignment

### Process Variables (Inputs)
1. **Spacer Size** (Type: Measurement) - Unit: inches - Description: "1/8\" to 1/4\" typical for floor tile"
2. **Tile Beating Pressure** (Type: Selection) - Options: Light, Medium, Firm - Description: "Firm pressure seats tile without over-compressing mortar"
3. **Lippage Measurement** (Type: Measurement) - Unit: mm or 1/16" - Description: "Height difference between adjacent tiles, must be <1/16\""

### Upstream Variables
1. **Floor Flatness** (Type: Upstream) - Source: Subfloor Prep - Target: ±1/8" in 10ft - Description: "Flat substrate is foundation for lippage-free installation"
2. **Thinset Consistency** (Type: Upstream) - Source: Mix Thinset - Target: Peanut butter - Description: "Proper consistency allows tiles to stay level"
3. **Layout Line Positions** (Type: Upstream) - Source: Layout Step - Target: Accurate grid - Description: "Layout accuracy determines final appearance"

### Outputs
1. **Lippage Control** (Type: major-aesthetics)
   - **Requirement:** Adjacent tile edges must be within 1/16 inch height difference per industry standards
   - **Potential Effects:** Lippage (uneven tile heights) is immediately visible and feels terrible underfoot. It creates tripping hazards, makes furniture wobble, prevents proper floor cleaning, and screams "amateur installation". Excessive lippage (>1/8 inch) may violate building codes and definitely reduces home value. It cannot be fixed after grouting without removing and resetting all affected tiles.
   - **Key Inputs:** Substrate flatness, Mortar consistency, Beating pressure, Trowel technique, Tile warpage
   - **Quality Checks:** Use a 4-foot level across every 3-4 tiles. Rock it gently - it should contact all tiles evenly with no gaps. Run your hand across tile intersections - they should feel perfectly smooth with no edges catching your fingers. Install a tile leveling system if working with large format tiles.

2. **Consistent Joint Spacing** (Type: major-aesthetics)
   - **Requirement:** All grout joints must be uniform width ±1/32 inch throughout installation
   - **Potential Effects:** Inconsistent joint spacing looks unprofessional and draws the eye to imperfections. Joints that vary by more than 1/16 inch create a wavy appearance that gets worse as you progress across the floor. Wide spots collect more dirt and are harder to clean. Narrow spots may not allow proper grout penetration, leading to weak joints that crack and crumble. This cannot be fixed without removing tiles.
   - **Key Inputs:** Spacer size, Spacer placement, Tile alignment, Layout accuracy
   - **Quality Checks:** Check joint widths constantly as you work. Use spacers on all four sides of every tile. Every few tiles, measure several joints with a ruler to verify they're all the same width. View your work from 10 feet away at a low angle to spot spacing issues early.

### Time Estimation (per tile)
- **Low (Experienced, 12x12):** 4 minutes
- **Medium (Average DIYer, 12x12):** 7 minutes
- **High (Beginner, 12x12):** 12 minutes

**Note:** Larger tiles take proportionally longer (18x18 = 1.5x time, 24x24 = 2x time)

## Time Estimation Standards (Research Summary)

Based on industry standards and professional installer data:

### Cutting Times (per tile)
- Straight cuts with wet saw: 2-5 minutes depending on experience
- Notched cuts: 3-8 minutes
- Drilling holes: 2-4 minutes per hole

### Mortar Application (per 10 sq ft)
- Experienced: 3-5 minutes
- Average DIYer: 5-8 minutes  
- Beginner: 8-12 minutes

### Tile Setting (per sq ft)
- Small tiles (4x4 to 8x8): 0.15-0.25 hrs/sq ft
- Medium tiles (12x12): 0.08-0.15 hrs/sq ft
- Large tiles (18x18+): 0.10-0.18 hrs/sq ft

### Factors Affecting Time
- **Tile size**: Larger = fewer pieces = faster per sq ft
- **Pattern**: Straight = baseline, Diagonal = +30%, Herringbone = +100%
- **Skill level**: Beginner is 2-3x slower than professional
- **Room complexity**: More cuts around fixtures = slower
